# Sneaker Store SQL Project 👟

This was my first SQL project from Khan Academy’s SQL course. The prompt was to design a store database that sells one type of item, so I chose sneakers.

## 🏪 What's in the project?

* A `sneakers` table with:

  * `id`
  * `brand`
  * `model`
  * `size`
  * `price`
  * `in_stock`
* I added 15 different sneakers to the table
* Wrote a few queries to:

  * Sort sneakers by price
  * Find the average price
  * Show the most expensive pair

## 🛠️ Tools Used

* SQL (ran and tested it on [sqliteonline.com](https://sqliteonline.com))
* Just used basic `CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT`, and `SELECT` statements

## 📊 What I learned

* How to structure a table for a real-life item
* How to use `ORDER BY`, `AVG()`, and `LIMIT`
* Why data types matter when designing tables

This was actually pretty fun and helped me start thinking like a data analyst. More projects coming soon 👀
